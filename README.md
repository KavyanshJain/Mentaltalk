## What is this?

I built this as part of my minor project at [University Name]. Mental health is something I care about, and I wanted to create a simple space where people can talk and get thoughtful responses backed by actual mental health resources. It's not a replacement for professional help, but it's a start — and honestly, it was a great way for me to learn about LLM applications, RAG, and full-stack development.

## Features

- User login and signup with session management
- Chat with an AI that understands mental health topics
- Answers are grounded in 28 mental health PDFs using RAG
- Mood dashboard to track your emotional patterns over time
- Chat history — pick up conversations where you left off
- Session restore — your chats are saved and can be revisited

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend | Streamlit |
| LLM | Gemini API |
| Vector Store | ChromaDB |
| Database | Neon PostgreSQL |
| Embeddings | sentence-transformers (local) |
| Deployment | Streamlit Community Cloud |

## How it works

When you send a message, the app searches through 28 mental health PDFs to find relevant information. This context, along with your message, is sent to the Gemini API which generates a helpful response. Your mood is also tracked based on the conversation and stored in the database, so you can see patterns over time in the mood dashboard.

## Setup & Run locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mentaltalk.git
   cd mentaltalk
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgres_url
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | API key from Google Gemini |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection URL from Neon |

```

## Limitations & Future Scope

Honestly, there's a lot that could be better. Right now, the app is pretty basic — it works, but it's not perfect.

**Limitations:**
- The RAG retrieval could be smarter and more accurate
- Mood tracking is simple and based on text analysis, not a proper assessment
- No conversation history export
- The UI is functional but could be more polished

**Future improvements:**
- Better conversation context handling
- More accurate mood tracking with proper sentiment analysis
- Support for voice input
- Mobile-responsive design
- Export chat history as PDF or text
- Multi-language support

## Acknowledgements

This project wouldn't have been possible without the mental health resources from [PDF sources] that I used for the RAG knowledge base. A big thanks to my professors and peers at [University Name] for their guidance and support throughout this minor project.

The app is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud, and the model embeddings are available on Hugging Face at [huggingface.co/Kavyansh575/mentaltalk](https://huggingface.co/Kavyansh575/mentaltalk).
